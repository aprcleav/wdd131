        <p>April Cleaver has been sketching her world since she could first hold a pencil. What began as playful doodles grew into private art lessons, AP art classes in high school, and college-level courses that deepened her craft. Today, her creative journey continues online, where she eagerly explores new styles and techniques from fellow artists around the globe. 
            <br><br>
        Her sketchbook is filled with pencil and ink drawings—raw, spontaneous, and full of character—but her finished pieces come to life digitally on her iPad. Blending traditional foundations with modern tools, she creates work that feels both timeless and fresh.

            <p>During her college years, April met her husband, and together they began building a family. Now the proud mom of three sons, she finds inspiration in the joy, chaos, and love that fill her everyday life. When she's not drawing, she's hiking evergreen trails, laughing with her family, or strumming her guitar (still learning, but enjoying the process).</p>

            <p>Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development through BYU-Pathway Worldwide, April is excited to combine her passions for art, technology, and storytelling into a fulfilling creative career.</p>
